        <h2>On something else</h2>
        <p>
	  I don't know why you are reading all of this, but if you are here you hopefully could find that some sort of entertaining.
    Or just really, really very mean and salty. I am a very salty person. Probably toxic in some sence. So I assume that my
    introversery might be quite beneficial for all of society I am completely depend on and hate from all of fibers of my soul.
    May be you smiled a little or just laughed at my pittiness. I don't care really. That's just some site which had been made
    for couple of hours and probably would never see the light of the internet. If you read this, it made its path to internet, I guess.
    They say NETWORKING!!! PROJECTS!!@ CONTRIBUTION##! VALUE!@#. Guys, most of you are either successfull bloggers (and of course
    I recognize that it means that you certainly came through lot of struggle and instability and shit), or seasoned mid/seniors 
    who applied in much more fruitful times, but let's face it. You are not in position to share your valuable opinion here. 
    It seems like you have little to no idea of what it means to be the junior. Not even junior now, but just junior. May be you forgot or something. 
    I have no coool projects or contributions or connections. Guys, I am litterally across the atlantic ocean from y'all, and on top of that 
    I am very introversial person (you could perfectly guess that from just style of my writing).
        </p>
        <h3>Subsection</h3>
        <p>
	  You know what? I spend more of my time to write these blog posts than to design and write structure and design of this site.
    So allow me to share very valuable knowledge from ancient times.

    Jokes aside, original of this text is quite cool view of Cicero about pleasure and struggle of this world. You should probably check it out,
    because it is 2000+ish years old, but perfectly relevant in our times.
