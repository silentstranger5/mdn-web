        <h2>On theory and application</h2>
        <p>
	  Nowadays I very often hear the opinion that theory does not matter. It is true, but it is false. First of all, the most famous thing
    I encounter here and there is so-called 'impostor syndrom'. It is comprised from two facts. First fact is that you have no experience,
    so you can't build everything that you want. Well, that's manageable. Many people make fun from learning along the path. But there is
    another, second component in that feeling. I don't know is that just me, or not. But the point is that, we don't really know what is 
    going on down here, beyond layers upon layers upon layers of abstraction. All we are doing can be perfectly described as playing lego
    with nice and shiny black boxes. Many people are really fine with that. Who care? People with PhDs and Turing Awards had figured that
    out for me, why should I bother? Market of computing architectures is saturated, market of operating systems is saturated, market of
    compilers is saturated. You don't need really many people to just support that stuff. 99% of us never would get any chance to work in
    that field.

        <h3>Subsection</h3>
        <p>
	  It does not mean though, that just because it is irrelevant to you, and you won't be working with that, you shouldn't care. First of
    all, it does unlock some ways of thinking and looking of problems and solve them compared to other people. It trains your brain and 
    abstract thinking and logic reasoning. And you can apply these knowledge sometimes, but rather rare, than often, when working on some
    thing simple. But more you would advance, more theoretical knowledge you would need. This should be part of your experience along with
    your practical knowledge. Really good and sound theoretical understanding and ability to apply it in practice when needed, might be 
    valuable and highlight you. Besides that the point of theoretical knowledge is not about 'how to build X'. If you need just that, 
    then go straight to your bootcamp. For you, this expensive education doesn't worth it. But here is a problem. Most of tools, of
    course provide layers of abstraction, but they assume and imply that you know what you are doing. It is supposed that you
    have some idea about how that works under the hood, so that you can learn this tool fast and make most use of it. If you don't,
    then there is nothing bad in short term: you can have a job with salary. But market is changing, and tools are changing constantly,
    and without basic knowledge it is hard to keep up with that. Besides all of that, computer science is just awfull lot of fun.
