        <h2>On economical context</h2>
        <p>
	  Right now is the most terrible time to go out and seek your job as junior. Awful lot of very bad curcimstances makes junior
    job market completely impenetratable. The leitmotif I hear here and there is 'Build your projects'. Really sound advice.
    Don't just stop learning because 'you ve got the basics'. There is no such a thing as enough learning. What it implies is:
    well, market is in very deep and stinky ass, so you would probably just do your thing and pray and believe, that
    it gets better in some time. Maybe it would. Maybe we all will be replaced with GPT-5. But in any case, `job` is not the 
    main purpose of your journey in tech. If it is I believe that you would refuse that idea straight away and go somewhere else.
    I am serious, I don't really need all of these crowds of applicants out of thin air, I also need to eat.

	  But seriously, it is not really something about passion and all of that. But no it really is. You probably would need to be
    passionate about what you are doing to not just DEEZ NUTS at such times. Everything sucks and everythere sucks butts, but 
    now it sucks completely hard. So the best way for me to handle such thing is to remind myself, that I am here not because
    JOB and STONKS and PROFIT and CAPITAL. If that would be the case, I would be completely desperate already and just left the
    field behind. Comparison is thief of joy, so just shutdown all of your internet and allow just pages from google and
    push requests to github. Of course, treat your self as a plant with plenty of sun and water, and do excercises, and
    don't forget to relax. But go ahead and do it anyways. Keep pushing. Even one small step a day is much better that nothing
    at all. If you will continue to do that, may be you finally would survive. Or will be captured into AI slavery.
    Or not push something either. Just do your thing. Be it C and DSA or HTML and CSS or setting up your HTTP and DNS server,
    or nice session of SICP, it does not matter. Just do your thing.
