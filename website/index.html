        <h2>Home page</h2>
        <p>
	  Honestly, I don't really feel like front-end developer. But power and ease with which you can build your web page is just amazing.
    Of course, this page is really simple, but genuinely I just like it. As well as process of creating such page. It is looking awesome
    for me. There are no bells and whistles, no gradients, round corners, no background images, or whatever. What I love the most is
    the fact that design process is absolutely and entirely controlled by me. I felt awful learning all of these concepts, that was really
    boring and dry. But that absolutely costed it. Not all things you can do are shiny and lovely out there. You need to be able to grind.
    This is really powerful when you can just sit for couple hours, and boom, your page is done. And I like it. And I like the process.
    It's fun.

	  Now, of course, that's just beginning, and there is so much to learn, and that is not enough and blah-blah-blah. But you now what?
    For me, I don't think that I would prioretize front-end in the first place. I don't feel like I really want to dig dive into this field.
    May be interface and feel and look and shape all matter, but I don't care. Now that's enough for me to create something as simple as that.
    And of course, that not my main skill, but just additional, which allow me to make quick and simple interface. I don't need bells and whistles.
    But raw html looks awful, and I really don't like that either. Yes, that took some time, but now I can do something just fine. My journey would
    probably continue to JavaScript, because that's just the most hireable language out there. (But entire market just collapsed, so all I can do now
    is just learning).
