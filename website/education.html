        <h2>On educational system</h2>
        <p>
    It somewhat plays across 'theory and application' but is more about educational system. Particularly high education in US.
    Let me introduce myself. I am from Russia. Yes, we had very strong academic world and very good education back in soviet
    times (or at least this is what elder people say). But the point is that now our education is just sucks terrible.
    Our educational system is absolutely awful. It really feels terrible. I literally had to go and learn English
    because I could not find anything in my native language. Guys, you are just insane. You really can not appreciate all of
    this free content which is available for you just for free. Oh, you now complain about tutorial hell, and stuff. But you
    guess what? I just had nothing, absolutely nothing to deal with. It is dead silence here, and many pieces of information
    are not represented in such form and quality and deep coverage in my language. Some automatic translation tools help,
    but that's not the solution.
        </p>
        <h3>Subsection</h3>
        <p>
	  But wait a minute, are not we talking about education? That's a colledge degree, and it is very very very expensive.
    Yeah, I know, but you can get equivalent knowledge of degree without any money. Most resources are available for free.
    I am seasoned pirate on the internet, I have no nearly any money which are enough to purchase books in your country, and your
    Amazon doesn't deliver at Russia anyway. So thats not even 'piratebay' or whatever. Just good old google and '{bookname} pdf'.
    That's all you need. If you care only about piece of paper, you really are doing something wrong and have no idea about
    value and purpose of academic knowledge you have access to.
