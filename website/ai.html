        <h2>On artificial intelligence</h2>
        <p>
    Very contradictory question, really. Middles and seniors don't give a shit, they are irreplaceble, so they just enjoy shiny tool.
    But that is a disaster for junior. If your productivity and impact are comparible of that of GPT, you are just very expensive
    burden for your company. You will be cutted off immediately and straight away, because all of your 'valuable skills' will be
    quickly and easily replaced with AI. Of course, it does not apply to most noble of us, the ladies and gentleman of knowledge
    and passion. Not us, just them, (may be you included, reader), really. I'm not even a junior, but nevertheless, it feels
    awfull for someone on entry level. You can't stop progress, so now your hard work may be very comparable of that of
    machine which just spits out statistically nice data in your face. Deal with it. Or may be use it. I am not opponent of AI usage,
    but I don't use it. And I will hate it with furious rage until I can become middle/senior dev, when that just becomes nice
    and cute little tool and I don't care. Until that I am in rageous opposition, because I am desperate noob, and I am very offended.

	  If you are not in such position that robotical hand just cutts off years of your hard and desperate work and struggle, and 
    if you just can put that aside, then of course GPT is amazing and marvelous and delightful. For corporate people or for
    people who are not so easy to replace. For most of us, corporate-dystopian furious hell of cyberpunk starts now. It will probably
    would be 'good for humanity'. Maybe for your children or for children of your children, but certainly not for you. Not at all, really.
    You are now extincting specie, someone who suffered struggle (or maybe enjoyed it in some sence), but nontheless, these good old
    times are now completely over. Welcome to brave new world. Adjust to it, maybe if you would master these AI skills, you can
    pretend that it is you who control AI, not the other way around.
